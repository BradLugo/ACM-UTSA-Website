#ACM UTSA Website

This repository is dedicated to the ACM club within UTSA. As a club supporting software development we encourage our members to aid us in our efforts to develop a great website for our club. This shall also be a great opportunity for those interested in a project to further themselves professionally.

###Development Plans:

Our development plans are to utilize the <a href ="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate">HTML5 Boiler Plate</a> and <a href = "https://github.com/angular/angular.js">AngularJs</a>. 

Feature updates and content requests will be handled through issues. We recommend that anyone who wants to contribute first create an issue for their feature then fork a version of this repository and make a pull request once your additions are made. 

All pull requests will be reviewed by our webmaster and added if deemed necessary. If changes are needed to your fork, we will recommend these changes and deny the pull request until they are fixed. Please feel free to ask if you need help with your changes.

### Testing
To run the site on your local machine, you may use the python script "run.py" that's provided. You must have python included in your path. Just type ./run.py in the directory. This will start an HTTP server on port 3000 by default but you may specify the port you want such as "./run.py 8000".
