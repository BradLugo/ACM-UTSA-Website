#ACM UTSA Website

This repository is dedicated to the ACM club within UTSA. As a club supporting software development we encourage our members to aid us in our efforts to develop a great website for our club. This shall also be a great opportunity for those interested in a project to further themselves professionally.

###Development Plans:

Our development plans are to utilize the <a href ="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, <a href = "https://github.com/angular/angular.js">Angular.js</a>, and <a href = "https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>. 

All pull requests will be reviewed by our Webmaster and added if deemed necessary. If changes are needed to your fork, we will recommend these changes and deny the pull request until they are fixed. Please feel free to ask if you need help with your changes.

###Features: 
Feature updates and content requests will be handled through issues. The name of the issue should be a generalized version of your change. Afterwards include a description of your update, whether or not it is a new page and where the content should be located or updated. If the feature is a new page, please provide content for that page. 

The leadership will handle the initial configuration and features of the website with the Webmaster acting as an intermediary. Every feature must be logged through an issue to provide ample documentation for changes. Each feature request must be reviewed and tested before being committed to the master codebase.
